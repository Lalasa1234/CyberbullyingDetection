### Choice of Model Selection 
I have used 

### Text Toxicity Prediction ðŸ’¬
Our text classification BERT model is trained on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Dataset to predict the toxicity of texts to pre-emptively prevent any occurrence of cyberbullying and harassment before they tend to occur. We're chose BERT as to overcome challenges including understanding the context of text so as to detect sarcasm and cultural references, as it uses Masked Transformer Encoders and Attention Mechanism to understand the relationship between words and sentences, the context from a given sentence.
